An introductory course for using R given to UP Students at the beginning of the semester/
The main purpose is that students have installed R, and are able to format the data so they can use different econometric methods such as linear and non-linear regressions, PCA, etc.

The course covers the following topics:

1. Installation of R and R Studio
2. Knowledge of the basic R objects (vector, matrix, data.frame, functions)
3. Using dplyr package to select, order and re-arrange your data
4. Reshape your data (wide and long formats)

There is indeed a lot of materials available to self-learn R on the internet, but I collected what I considered the bare minimum to know about R to be able to start working with your data and start econometric modelling.

Some sections have been translated in French, but the translation is still on-going for some chapters.
