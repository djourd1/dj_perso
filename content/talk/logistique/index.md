Using the package `RTutor`, I developed a complete online tutorial to conduct logit and probit regressions with R. The tutorial is designed for self-study and should help you through basic operations such as importing data to the analysis of the results (average partial effects, etc.). Small quizzes and hand-on exercises are provided. 

Following the link will bring you to a dashboard with seven tabs:

+ Importing your data
+ Check your data
+ Reading the results
+ Interpreting the results (2 tabs)
+ Evaluating the quality of your model
