abstract: "Sustainable intensification seeks to increase outputs from existing farmland in ways that have a
lower environmental impact. An extensive literature has examined the determinants of farmers’
adoption of the different agro-ecological cropping systems needed to achieve these goals. However, the farmers’ preferences for the attributes of these systems and the decision processes for
choosing between available systems is still poorly understood. To fill this gap, this paper proposes
a methodology that relies on a discrete choice experiment to analyse farmers’ preferences for
cropping systems and estimate the heterogeneity of decision processes among farmers. We
modelled three major types of decision processes potentially used by farmers to evaluate the
systems that are not consistent with the standard utility maximization framework. These findings
offer insights into the behavioural patterns of respondents and should help crop system promoters
and developers to better understand how their proposed systems are likely to be evaluated by
different types of farmers. "

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We used discrete choice experiments to explore the potential adoption of alternative agricultural systems. We analyse the heterogeneity of farmers’ preferences and heuristics of choices using a latent class model, where class can include different heuristics such as attribute non attendance, and elimination by aspect."
